<h2>Experience:</h2>
<h3>VISUAL ARTIST  <br>
OWN BUSINESS - VISUAL ARTIST WERONIKA MISIAK</h3>
(2019 - now) <br>
Creating designs that combine beauty and usability.
Understanding customer needs and delivering projects that fully meet their expectations.
Creating logo designs, illustrations, graphics for social media.
I create AR filters for social media. Last year I organized an exhibition in one of the cafes in Szczecin. The main theme
was digital collages that "came to life" thanks to Instagram or Facebook AR filters. Both the collages and the filters
dedicated to them were created by me. 
I conducted training for individuals and representatives of non-governmental organizations in the field of computer graphics (at the Culture Incubator in Szczecin).
Recently, I have expanded the offer and design of websites and online stores on Wordpress and WooCommerce.
I make sure that the website is clear, intuitive and optimized.

Preparation of packaging graphic designs food. My communication skills were pivotal in collaborating effectively with clients. 
I regularly conducted meetings to thoroughly understand their needs and expectations, enabling me to tailor projects to their requirements
effectively. My creativity was utilized in creating layouts and retouching photos to produce visually appealing and brand aligned packaging. 
I remained open to client suggestions and routinely adjusted projects based on their feedback, contributing to client satisfaction and the realization of their vision. 
Additionally, working with the Brandbook required meticulousness and attention to detail in ensuring the highest quality materials submitted for printing, contributing to brand
consistency and the professional appearance of products.
