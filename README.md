<h2>About Me:</h2>
I am Weronika Misiak, an aspiring software tester with a strong foundation in IT. My journey in the IT industry began with a focus on UX/UI design, where I honed my skills through various courses and training programs. This background provided me with a unique perspective on user-centric testing, which I now bring into my role as a software tester. I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the West Pomeranian University of Technology, further deepening my knowledge in the field.

I am committed to continuous learning and staying updated with the latest trends in software testing. As I progress in my studies and career, I aim to expand my expertise in various testing methodologies, including manual, automated, and performance testing.

In addition to my testing expertise, I have a solid background in designing and developing responsive websites and e-commerce stores.
